In computer science, a variable is a storaged location paired with with an associated symbolic identifier, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.
Javascript uses 'let' and 'const' to store a variable pair, which the former is mutable and the latter is immutable. Define two other variables c and d, which the c is mutable and equals to 3 and d is immutable and equals to 4.

When Javascript variables are declared. they have an initial value of undefined.
Initialise the two variables 'a' and 'b' with 5 and 10 respectively so that they will not be undefined.
